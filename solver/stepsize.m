function[a] = stepsize(step,x,grad,descent,itr)
% This function calculates step size. "stepsize_rule.rule" specifies which rule are used. Available step size rules and
% necessary additional arguments are below. Default rule is "deminishing".
% "diminishing": No additional arguments are needed. Step size at k-th iteration is 2/k+2.
% "constant": Constant number used for step size is in "step.stepsize". This variable must be in [0,1]. Might not work if problem 
% data is not strongly convex.
% "optimal": step.stepfunc is the function(x,grad,descent) which calculates optimal
%            step size at x along descent. This function must return the stepsize within [0,1].
% "Armijo": step.f is the objective function f(x).
% "Lipschitz": step.L is a Lipschitz constant of the gradient of the objective function.
