function [value] = eleSym(x,k)
%ELESYM Return the value of the k-th elementary symmetric polynomial at x
%
% The idea is that the value of the k-th elementary symmetric polynomial at
% x corresponds to coefficient of y^k in \prod_{i=1}^n (1+x_i*y). Then,
% we evaluate \prod_{i=1}^n (1+x_i*y) through a
% simple divide-and-conquer algorithm.
% Polynomial multiplication is done with the "conv"
% function. An approach using FFTs would have a better complexity, but
% in our experiments, unless the degree is very large,  "conv" is faster.
