function [vec] = grad_eleSym(x,indexes,k)
%grad_eleSym Return the gradient of the k-th elementary symmetric polynomial of x(indexes).
%This function uses the fact that 
% d eleSym(x(indexes),k) /d x_i = 0 if i is not in indexes, and
% d eleSym((x_1,...,x_n),k) /d x_i = eleSym((x_1,...,x_i-1,x_i+1,...,x_n),k-1) otherwise.
n = length(x);
vec = zeros(n,1);
for i = 1:n
    if ismember(i,indexes)
        vec(i) = eleSym(x(setdiff(indexes,i)),k-1);
    end
