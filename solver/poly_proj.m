function[x,status] = poly_proj(x0,p,e,opts)
%Computes a low-to-medium accuracy orthogonal projection of x0 onto the hyperbolicity 
%cone given by p and e using the dual Frank-Wolfe method in FW_HP.m.
%By default, x0 is scaled to have 2-norm less or equal than 1 before being passed 
%to the solver and, then, the output is unscaled back. This can 
%be disabled by setting opts.scale = False.
% 
%See poly_proj_examples.m for examples.
%
%Input:
%x0 - [m by 1 vector]
%p - set of polynomials following the format described in FW_HP.m
%e - [m by 1 vector]
%opts - options to be passed to the solver, see opts argument in FW_HP.m.
%Addionally, it is possible to set opts.scale to false in order to disable 
%input scaling.
%
%
%Output:
%x - [m by 1 vector] 
%status: it is the same as the output argument "status" of FW_HP.m:
%       status - 1: Obtained a feasible solution with FW gap <= stop.gap_tol
%                2: Obtained a feasible solution but FW gap stop criterion
%                was not satisfied. In this case, x is the feasible solution 
%                found with the smallest FW gap.
%                3: No primal feasible solution found. In this case, 
%                x is the solution found with the smallest feasibility
%                violation.
%       time: total running time.
%       itr: total number of iterations.
%       FW_gap: Best FW_gap found. It is Inf if no dual feasible solution
%       was found
